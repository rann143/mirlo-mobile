# Mirlo Mobile App

**Built with React Native & TypeScript**

***Currently Under Development**

This is the official mobile app for [Mirlo](https://mirlo.space) developed in collaboration with the Mirlo team. This app will allow users to listen to their purchased songs and the publicly available catalog of music. Check out [Mirlo's GitHub](https://github.com/funmusicplace/mirlo)!

The current focus is developing for iOS. Development for Android is on the roadmap.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **v20+** (the CI workflow and `eas-cli` 18.x both require ≥ 20)
- npm
- For iOS: Xcode 26+ (Expo SDK 55 / `expo-modules-core` uses Swift 6.2 syntax — Xcode 16 ships only Swift 6.1 and won't build) and [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
- For Android: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (or just the [command-line tools](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/android-commandlinetools)) plus the API 35 system image, build-tools 35, and platform-tools

### Setup

1. Run API Locally

   Follow instructions in [mirlo's README](https://github.com/funmusicplace/mirlo/blob/main/README.md)

2. Set up env variables & install dependencies

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   npm install
   ```

   `npm install` runs `patch-package` via the `postinstall` script — see [Patched dependencies (Android)](#patched-dependencies-android) below.

3. Build and run the native app

   For iOS:

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

   For Android (set `ANDROID_HOME` / `JAVA_HOME` and have an emulator running first — see [Android setup](#android-setup) below):

   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

4. Start Metro on its own (after the native build is installed)

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

Follow Expo's guides to set up a development build for your iOS simulator:

- [Setting up the iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Create build for iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/simulators/)

**Note:** This project contains native dependencies, so it cannot be run in Expo Go. You must build the native app first using the commands above.

### Android setup

Android Studio installs the IDE; the SDK and emulator are separate. The fastest macOS path is:

```bash
brew install --cask android-studio
brew install --cask android-commandlinetools

export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$PATH"

# accept licenses, install SDK packages
yes | sdkmanager --licenses
sdkmanager "platform-tools" "emulator" \
  "platforms;android-35" "build-tools;35.0.0" \
  "system-images;android-35;google_apis_playstore;arm64-v8a"

# create + boot a Pixel 7 / API 35 AVD (one-time)
echo "no" | avdmanager create avd -n mirlo_test \
  -k 'system-images;android-35;google_apis_playstore;arm64-v8a' -d pixel_7
emulator -avd mirlo_test -no-snapshot &

# run the app — first build is ~10 min, incremental builds are ~10 sec
npx expo run:android
```

Persist the env block in your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`) so future shells pick it up automatically.

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Patched dependencies (Android)

Two transitive dependencies need patches to build and run on Android with Expo SDK 55 / RN 0.83 / Gradle 9 / New Architecture. Patches live in [`patches/`](patches/) and are auto-applied on `npm install` via the `postinstall` hook (uses [`patch-package`](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package)). Each patch is small (the published `.patch` files are the source of truth — read them when in doubt).

### `react-native-track-player+4.1.2.patch`

Three issues, all in `node_modules/react-native-track-player/android/src/main/java/com/doublesymmetry/trackplayer/`:

1. **`module/MusicModule.kt` — `originalItem!!` (×2).** Kotlin 2.1.20 (shipped with RN 0.83) enforces strict null-checks: `Arguments.fromBundle(Bundle)` no longer accepts `Bundle?`. Two call sites in `getTrack` and `getActiveTrack` needed the non-null assertion.
2. **`module/MusicModule.kt` — block-body conversion (37 methods).** RN 0.83 introduced `TurboModuleInteropUtils`, which inspects `@ReactMethod` JVM return types and rejects any module where a non-synchronous method returns non-`void`. Track-player's expression-body methods like `fun play(callback: Promise) = scope.launch { ... }` infer return type `kotlinx.coroutines.Job`, not `Unit`, and the parser throws `ParsingException: TurboModule system assumes returnType == void iff the method is synchronous` — which means **`TrackPlayerModule` won't load at all on Android**, cascading into "No QueryClient set", missing-default-export warnings, and a broken UI. The patch converts each method to a block body so the inferred return type is `Unit`.
3. **`service/MusicService.kt` — `reactHost` accessor.** Track-player's `emit()` and `emitList()` reach the JS context via `reactNativeHost.reactInstanceManager.currentReactContext`. Under New Architecture (Bridgeless), `HeadlessJsTaskService.getReactNativeHost()` throws `RuntimeException: You should not use ReactNativeHost directly in the New Architecture` the first time playback state changes. The patch adds a `currentReactContextOrNull()` helper that prefers `(applicationContext as ReactApplication).reactHost?.currentReactContext` and falls back to the legacy path inside try/catch.

**When can we drop this patch?**

Upstream landed all three fixes on `main` in [`5ce8412` (2025-06-25): "feat(android, ios): migrate the library to the new architecture"](https://github.com/doublesymmetry/react-native-track-player/commit/5ce8412). They were published as `5.0.0-alpha0` on 2025-08-12 — and as of this writing the [`latest` dist-tag still points to `4.1.2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-track-player), with no nightlies since 2025-09-24. Adopting the alpha is risky for two reasons worth understanding before you do it:

- **5.0.0-alpha0 changes the iOS audio engine.** It declares `shaka-player ^4.7.9` as a peer dependency, replacing the AVPlayer-based path. Background audio, lockscreen controls, and AirPlay all need re-validation on iOS.
- **The branch has been quiet for ~7 months.** Treat it as alpha-grade until activity resumes or `5.0.0` ships stable.

**Drop the patch when:**

1. `react-native-track-player@5.x` ships on the `latest` dist-tag (check with `npm view react-native-track-player dist-tags`), AND
2. After upgrading and re-running `npx expo run:android` cold on a clean install, all three of these greps produce the expected results:

```bash
# 1. Block-body methods (no expression-body @ReactMethod returning Job)
grep -E "fun [a-z]+\([^)]*\) = scope\.launch" \
  node_modules/react-native-track-player/android/src/main/java/com/doublesymmetry/trackplayer/module/MusicModule.kt
# Expect: no output. If matches appear, the TurboModule issue is back.

# 2. emit() must use reactHost (or be otherwise New-Arch safe)
grep -n "reactNativeHost.reactInstanceManager" \
  node_modules/react-native-track-player/android/src/main/java/com/doublesymmetry/trackplayer/service/MusicService.kt
# Expect: no output. If matches appear, the Bridgeless crash is back.

# 3. Strict-null fixes for getTrack / getActiveTrack
grep -c "originalItem!!" \
  node_modules/react-native-track-player/android/src/main/java/com/doublesymmetry/trackplayer/module/MusicModule.kt
# Expect: ≥ 2 OR upstream changed the type so !! is unnecessary. To verify the
# end-to-end story, temporarily delete patches/react-native-track-player+*.patch,
# run `npm install`, then `npx expo run:android`. If it builds and the app
# starts, the patch can go.
```

### `@react-native+gradle-plugin+0.83.2.patch`

Bumps `org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver-convention` from `0.5.0` to `1.0.0` in `node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin/settings.gradle.kts`. The 0.5.0 / 0.10.0 jars reference `JvmVendorSpec.IBM_SEMERU`, an enum value Gradle 9.0 removed; configuration fails with `Class JvmVendorSpec does not have member field 'IBM_SEMERU'`. Foojay 1.0.0 (Aug 2025) added Gradle 9 support.

**When can we drop this patch?**

Upstream fix already merged: [`664acaf` (2026-03-31), PR #56210: "fix: upgrade foojay-resolver-convention to 1.0.0"](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/56210). It is **not yet in any released version** — verified at the time of writing that `@react-native/gradle-plugin@0.85.2` (current `latest`) and `0.83.9` (latest patch on the `0.83-stable` channel we're on) both still pin foojay 0.5.0. The fix will likely first ship in **React Native 0.86**.

The gradle-plugin is version-locked to `react-native` itself — bumping it independently isn't safe. So this patch is tied to the broader RN upgrade, not a one-line bump.

**Drop the patch when:** this project upgrades to a React Native version that includes #56210 (most likely 0.86+). After the upgrade, verify:

```bash
grep "foojay-resolver-convention" \
  node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin/settings.gradle.kts
# Expect a version ≥ 1.0.0. If still 0.5.0 / 0.10.0 on Gradle ≥ 9, keep the patch.
```

### Operational notes

- Patches apply automatically on `npm install` via the `postinstall` script. If a patch fails to apply (because the underlying package version changed), `patch-package` prints a clear error pointing at the offending hunk.
- After bumping either of the two patched packages, re-run `npx expo run:android` cold to confirm. If everything still works, regenerate or delete the corresponding patch.
