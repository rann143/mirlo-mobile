# Mirlo Mobile App

**Built with React Native & TypeScript**

***Currently Under Development**

This is the official mobile app for [Mirlo](https://mirlo.space) developed in collaboration with the Mirlo team. This app will allow users to listen to their purchased songs and the publicly available catalog of music. Check out [Mirlo's GitHub](https://github.com/funmusicplace/mirlo)!

The current focus is developing for iOS. Development for Android is on the roadmap.

- Xcode (for iOS)
- [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) - For building native app
- npm

### Setup

1. Run API Locally

   Follow instructions in [mirlo's README](https://github.com/funmusicplace/mirlo/blob/main/README.md)

2. Set up env variables & install dependencies

Follow Expo's guides to set up a development build for your iOS simulator:

- [Setting up the iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Create build for iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/simulators/)

**Note:** This project contains native dependencies, so it cannot be run in Expo Go. You must build the native app first using the commands above.

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
